COSC 410: Artificial IntelligenceSpring 2016Mid-term Study GuideMid-term Date: 2/22/2016The mid-term will be a one hour affair with 8-10 questions plus a bonus question. Questions may be short answer questions, problems to work out, discussion of various approaches. Below are the topics that will be covered.Concepts¥ AIApproaches:CognitiveModeling,Simulation,Logicist,RationalAgent¥ Backward Chaining¥ BeliefStates¥ Boolean Operator, Introduction Rules, Elimination Rules¥ Clause¥ ClauseSet¥ Completeness¥ ConjunctiveNormalForm¥ ConstraintGraph¥ ConstraintSatisfactionProblem¥ Constraints:Unary,Binary,Global,Alldiff,Preference,Atmost¥ Cut-off¥ Cut-set¥ DefiniteClause¥ EvaluationFunctions¥ Forward Chaining¥ GraphSeparationProperty¥ Heuristics¥ Horn Clause¥ Intelligent Agents: Reflex, Goal-Based, Utility-Based, Hybrid, Learning¥ Literal¥ LogicalEntailment,Equivalence¥ Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens¥ PEAS Descriptions of Environment¥ Percepts&Actuators¥ ProblemCharacteristics¥ Prolog¥ PropositionalLogic¥ Quantifier¥ RefutationProcedure¥ SearchTrees:And-OrTrees,StochasticTrees¥ Search: Uninformed vs. Heuristic (Informed)¥ Soundness¥ Syntax vs. Semantics¥ TreeDecomposition
